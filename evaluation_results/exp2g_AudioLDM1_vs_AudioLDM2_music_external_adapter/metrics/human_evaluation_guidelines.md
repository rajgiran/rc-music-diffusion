# Human Audio Evaluation Guidelines

## Pre-Experiment Setup
- High-quality headphones/monitors, quiet room (<40 dB), calibrated volume
- 20–100+ participants depending on rigor
- Randomized, blinded A/B with confidence rating

## Protocol (summary)
1) Briefing & practice (10 min)
2) Main evaluation (30–45 min): A/B pairs, forced choice + confidence (1–5)
3) Breaks every 15–20 pairs
4) Post-eval questionnaire and debrief

## Primary Statistics
- Binomial tests (α=0.05), effect sizes (Cohen's h), CIs
- Inter-rater reliability (correlation/ICC)

## Ethics & QC
- Informed consent, right to withdraw, anonymized data
- Attention checks, response time filters, integrity checks
